Folder/File Structure

It is structured in a monolithic way, The folder structure help us achieve seperation of concerns in a way that every aspect of this project start within the scope in it's own "index.js" file and it's being imported to other files as a dependency.

- server.js: This is the main entry point of the project which starts the server and also initiazes the connection with the database
- loaders: Split the startup process into modules
- models: Database models
- config: configuration related stuff and Internal Data Models
- services: All the business logic is here
- handlers: Response Handlers and Error Handlers
- routes: Contains all the API routes
- tests: Tests of all sorts

## 3 Layer architecture
The idea is to use the principle of separation of concerns to move the business logic away from the node.js API Routes. Itâ€™s just a collection of classes with clear purposes, following the SOLID principles applied to node.js.

## How to Run
- npm i 
- npm start

To run tests type "npm test"

## Continous Integration/Continous Deployement
- Travis CI has been implemented in this project and after the tests runs successfully it dockerize the app and upload to heroku.
